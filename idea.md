# NSE India API Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines our plan to integrate the NSE India API into our main application to fetch real-time stock quotes and market data. The integration will enable us to build trading features, market analysis tools, and portfolio tracking.

## Goals
1. Implement a robust API wrapper for NSE India data
2. Create a caching mechanism to respect rate limits
3. Develop core data models for stock information
4. Design a flexible architecture for future expansion

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core API Integration
- Set up the NSE package and configure download folders
- Create a service layer to abstract API interactions
- Implement basic error handling and retry mechanisms
- Build initial data models for quotes and market information

### Phase 2: Data Management
- Design a caching strategy to minimize API calls
- Implement a database schema for storing market data
- Create background jobs for periodic data updates
- Add data validation and transformation utilities

### Phase 3: Feature Development
- Build a dashboard for market overview
- Implement watchlist functionality
- Create stock detail views with technical indicators
- Develop search and filtering capabilities

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Add portfolio tracking
- Implement basic trading signals based on technical analysis
- Create alerting system for price movements
- Develop historical data visualization

## Technical Approach

### API Wrapper
```python
class NSEService:
    def __init__(self, cache_dir='./cache'):
        self.nse = None
        self.cache_dir = cache_dir
        self._initialize()
    
    def _initialize(self):
        # Create cache directory if it doesn't exist
        os.makedirs(self.cache_dir, exist_ok=True)
        self.nse = NSE(download_folder=self.cache_dir)
    
    def get_quote(self, symbol):
        try:
            return self.nse.quote(symbol)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error fetching quote for {symbol}: {e}")
            return None
    
    def get_multiple_quotes(self, symbols):
        results = []
        for symbol in symbols:
            # Add delay to respect rate limiting
            time.sleep(0.5)
            quote = self.get_quote(symbol)
            if quote:
                results.append(quote)
        return results
    
    def close(self):
        if self.nse:
            self.nse.exit()
```

### Caching Strategy
- Implement time-based caching (15-minute refresh)
- Store frequent lookups in memory cache
- Persist historical data in database
- Add cache invalidation for market open/close events

### Data Models
- Stock (symbol, name, sector, etc.)
- Quote (price, change, volume, etc.)
- Market (indices, overall status)
- User Portfolio (holdings, watch lists)

## Integration Points

### Main Application
- Add NSE data provider to application services
- Create API endpoints for fetching market data
- Implement background workers for data updates
- Add user interface components for stock data

### User Experience
- Real-time price updates on dashboard
- Watchlist management interface
- Stock detail pages with price charts
- Search functionality for finding stocks

## Risk Mitigation

### Rate Limiting
- Implement exponential backoff for API failures
- Use cached data when rate limits are reached
- Queue and batch requests where possible
- Monitor API usage and optimize call patterns

### Data Integrity
- Validate all incoming API data
- Handle API structure changes gracefully
- Log and alert on data inconsistencies
- Implement fallback data sources where possible

## Success Metrics
- API reliability (>99.5% success rate)
- Data freshness (quotes <15 minutes old during market hours)
- System performance (dashboard load time <2s)
- User engagement with market data features

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment with NSE package
2. Create proof-of-concept for basic quote retrieval
3. Design database schema for market data
4. Implement basic caching mechanism
5. Develop initial UI mockups for data display

This plan provides a structured approach to integrating the NSE India API while ensuring reliability, performance, and a good user experience.
