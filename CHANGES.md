### 2. Authentication Flow Improvement

- Modified the Zerodha authentication flow to store tokens in the database

### 3. Settings Management

## How to Test the Changes

1. Deploy the application to Railway with a PostgreSQL database
2. Navigate to the authentication page (/auth/refresh)

4. Verify that the authentication status shows the correct username and expiration time
5. Restart the application and verify that the authentication persists
6. Check the settings page to ensure settings are loaded from the database

## Next Steps
