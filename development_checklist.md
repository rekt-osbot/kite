# Kite Trading Bot - Development Checklist

Based on the code audit and your responses, this checklist outlines the development work required to address the identified issues.

## High Priority Fixes

### 1. Token Expiration Handling Improvement
- **Context**: Zerodha API tokens expire daily at 6 AM IST, and the current periodic check approach is not reliable enough.
- **Approach**: 
  - Improve token expiration detection to accurately identify when tokens have expired
  - Enhance notification system to send clear alerts when token refresh is needed
  - Implement graceful degradation when token is expired (disable trading but maintain system availability)
  - Add clear user instructions in notifications for manual token renewal process
  - Create monitoring dashboard to show token status and expiration time
- **Success Criteria**: System gracefully handles token expiration and provides clear user guidance for manual renewal

### 2. Error Handling in Critical Trading Functions
- **Context**: Trading functions in `chartink_webhook.py` need more robust error handling to prevent partial execution issues.
- **Approach**:
  - Identify all critical trading function paths (order placement, signal processing)
  - Implement granular exception handling with specific recovery strategies
  - Add transaction-like semantics for multi-step operations
  - Create isolated test module to verify the enhanced error handling
- **Success Criteria**: System handles API errors gracefully without leaving inconsistent state

### 3. Circular Dependency Risk Mitigation
- **Context**: Not all code paths consistently use lazy loading pattern, creating potential for circular import issues.
- **Approach**:
  - Audit all import statements in the codebase
  - Standardize use of the lazy loading pattern from `dependency_resolver.py`
  - Create test to detect potential circular dependencies
  - Document the import strategy for future code additions
- **Success Criteria**: No circular import errors occur during various app startup scenarios

### 4. Comprehensive Logging Implementation
- **Context**: Current logging is basic and lacks structured approach needed for production troubleshooting.
- **Approach**:
  - Design standardized logging structure with consistent fields
  - Add operational metrics collection for key events (trades, API calls)
  - Implement log levels appropriately (DEBUG vs INFO vs ERROR)
  - Create separate test module to verify logging functionality
- **Success Criteria**: All significant system events are logged with appropriate context

## Medium Priority Improvements

### 5. Centralize Market Hours Logic
- **Context**: Market hours checking logic is duplicated across multiple files with variations.
- **Approach**:
  - Extract all market hours logic to a dedicated module
  - Update all other modules to import from the central location
  - Add tests to verify consistent behavior across the application
- **Success Criteria**: Market hours logic exists in only one place and is correctly used throughout

### 6. Enhance Telegram Notification System
- **Context**: Notification system has redundancy and lacks flexibility for different types of alerts.
- **Approach**:
  - Refactor notification system to support categorized alerts
  - Add priority levels (critical, info, debug)
  - Implement throttling for frequent notifications
  - Add tests for notification functionality
- **Success Criteria**: Notifications are sent with appropriate categories and formatting

### 7. Extract HTML Templates
- **Context**: HTML templates are embedded in Python code, making maintenance difficult.
- **Approach**:
  - Create a templates directory
  - Extract embedded HTML to separate files
  - Implement proper template loading mechanism
  - Update code to use the external templates
- **Success Criteria**: All HTML is in separate files and properly loaded by the application

## Notes for Implementation

### API Rate Limiting
- No immediate action needed as trading volume is low (4-5 alerts per day)
- Current implementation is sufficient for the expected load

### Order Type Selection
- Maintain current approach of using CNC (delivery) orders for buy signals
- No need to implement intraday (MIS) trading functionality

### NSE Holiday Calendar
- No immediate action required

### File Storage Implementation
- Current file-based approach is acceptable given:
  - The app is deployed on Railway with cost considerations
  - Daily token expiration means persistence requirements are minimal
  - Concurrent access patterns are limited

## Development Approach

For each implementation item:

1. **Isolation**: Develop test implementation separate from main code
2. **Verification**: Create tests that verify the solution works as expected
3. **Integration**: Once verified, integrate with main codebase
4. **Validation**: Perform final testing to ensure no regressions
