## Operational Workflow

### 1. Daily Authentication Process

   - The app checks token validity periodically
   - You'll receive a notification via Telegram if configured

2. **Manual Refresh**:
   - Visit [YOUR_APP_URL/auth/refresh](https://your-app-url/auth/refresh)

   - Use the refresh buttons to update data in real-time

2. **Viewing ChartInk Alerts**:
   - Click "Alerts" in the navigation
   - This page displays all ChartInk alerts received today
   - Alerts are color-coded (green for buy signals, red for sell signals)
   - Each alert shows the scanner name, triggered time, and list of stocks with prices

3. **Configuring Trading Settings**:

     - Test button: Verify your Telegram configuration

### 3. Trading Process

1. **ChartInk Alert Trigger**:
   - When your ChartInk scanner detects matching stocks
   - It sends a webhook POST request to your app

2. **Webhook Processing**:
   - Your app receives the webhook data
   - Format:
     ```json
     {
         "stocks": "STOCK1,STOCK2,STOCK3",
         "trigger_prices": "100.5,200.5,300.5",
         "triggered_at": "2:34 pm",
         "scan_name": "Short term breakouts",
         "scan_url": "short-term-breakouts",
         "alert_name": "Alert for Short term breakouts"
     }
     ```
   - The alert is logged and displayed on the Alerts page
   - A notification is sent to Telegram (if configured)

3. **Available Funds Check**:
   - System checks if there are sufficient funds in your Zerodha account
   - If funds are insufficient, the alert is logged but no orders are placed
   - A notification is sent to Telegram about insufficient funds

4. **Transaction Type Determination**:
   - The app looks at the scan name to determine buy/sell
   - Buys if scan name contains: "buy", "bullish", "breakout"
   - Sells if scan name contains: "sell", "bearish", "short"

5. **Order Execution**:
   - For each stock in the alert:
     1. **Position Sizing**: Calculates quantity based on `MAX_POSITION_SIZE` and available funds
     2. **CNC Orders**: Uses delivery (CNC) order type for all trades
     3. **Stop-Loss Only**: For buy orders, places only stop-loss sell orders (no target orders)
     4. Logs the trade details and sends execution notification to Telegram

6. **Trade Management**:
   - Stop-loss orders handle risk management automatically
   - You manually manage taking profits (no automatic target orders)
   - You can monitor positions and orders in your app dashboard or Zerodha account
